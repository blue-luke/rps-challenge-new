# Rock, paper, scissors

A simple Rock, paper, scissors webapp using sinatra

## How to user

Visit the hosted url https://desolate-reaches-22369.herokuapp.com/

Otherwise:
- Copy repo to local computer
- Navigate to folder
- Run bundle to install depedencies
- Run rspec to check tests are working. Rspec might need to be installed manually ($ gem install rspec)
- Run rackup to see app running on local host

## Current issues

I had extensive problems hosting this app on heroku. Currently (14/02/22), adding rspec to the gemfile causes heroku deployment to fail. I'm unsure of the reason why.
